	<p>I was using pear for two of my homebrew projects <a href="https://github.com/icomefromthenet/Faker">Faker</a> and <a href="https://github.com/icomefromthenet/Migrations">Migrations</a>. I was not enamored by deployment steps and in my case struggles combined with lack of noob friendly documentation.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I decide to embrace composer and took the time to modify both libraries to use composer <a href="http://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/vendor-bins.md">vendor bins</a>. I registered both packages with <a href="https://packagist.org/">packagist</a> under the namespace <a href="https://packagist.org/search/?q=icomefromthenet">icomefromthenet</a>. I hope this improves the exposure of both projects.</p>

<p>My experience? Well I believe there is not enough documentation or tutorials for using composer with vendor bins. I had to look at the code from phpunit and behat to supplement my understanding. I took the path of registering both projects before they where ready. It took a few commits to work out the errors, I only hope no one tried to download the packages before they were fixed.</p>

<p>If I were to place another project on packagist I would wait and use a manual repository entry while testing and when complete place on packagist. </p>
